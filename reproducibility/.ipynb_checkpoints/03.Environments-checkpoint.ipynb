Mamba leverages conda, the basics of what you need to know is, `mamba` is very fast so you want to use it to manage your packages, install them or delete them for example, and we're going to use `conda` to manage our environments, create, delete and modify them. A workflow to start a new conda environment might look like the following:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n new_env\n",
