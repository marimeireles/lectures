    "# General Tools for Reproducible Science\n",
    "\n",
    "On this and the next few notebooks we're going to take a look in different tools to assist you in your open science pursue and that at the same time will save you time and resources to do better reproducible science.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this notebook we cover versioning system tools and tools useful for sharing code in the web. Further on we will explore toolsets to build robust softwares that will run in any system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the details of versioning system tools and websites, I'd like to add a note that Github is not the only place for that. Github is a Microsoft owned company and it's not open source, it allows you to host your code for free and perform many free operations but it's still under a large organization's roadmap. If you prefer an open source alternative that uses the same versioning system tool as Github and has very similar UI you can try [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), there are other alternatives out there too like Bitbucket and Jira.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide we will focus on Github because of its dominant market-share.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Github is not only useful for reproducible science because it makes it easier for you to share your code with peers, it's also a great tool for putting your code in the open.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also a good software practice to always have your code saved in a versioning control system.\n",
    "Github leverages `git` as its versioning control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look on the kinds of things you can do with it."
