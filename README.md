## Overview

This repository contains instructional resources developed by Mariana Meireles during her time as a Guest Lecturer at Harvard University. She was invited through the LSSTC-DSFP program to teach Astronomy graduate students from July to August 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts. The repository focuses on three key areas:

- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Performance in High Computational Science
- Reproducibility in Open Science

The materials are work-in-progress and are intended to serve as a resource for both educators and students interested in these topics.
