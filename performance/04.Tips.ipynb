    "In this notebook I share a few things I picked up learning about scientific software performance. These were written with the scientific development in Python in mind. If you're doing something different, like, profiling web environment, for example, they might be completely irrelevant. They might still be irrelevant inside the scientific software ecossystem, as many variables play a role on which kind of treatment you should give to data, as we've seen in previous sessions."

    "- For compression youâ€™ll probably find that you drop gzip and bz2, and embrace newer systems like lz4, snappy, and Z-Standard that provide better performance and random access.\n",

    "- When working on the cloud you may find that some older formats like HDF5 may not work as well.\n",
    "- You may want to partition or chunk your data in ways that align well to common queries. In Dask DataFrame this might mean choosing a column to sort by for fast selection and joins. For Dask Array this might mean choosing chunk sizes that are aligned with your access patterns and algorithms.\n"
